## Debug
Since Bluetooth is not supported on VMs is necessary to use a phone to develop and test.  
To Configure a phone follow: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/running-on-device-android.html  
After is all ready and running the app on the device to see the logs at the terminal use:

```bash
adb logcat | grep ReactNativeJS
```
